Version 3.10
  Laurent Orseau, Kieron Hardy, 201?-??-??
- fix: print-as-expression set to #f in all cases

Version 3.9
  Laurent Orseau, Kieron Hardy, 2012-10-31
- added: editor-canvas widget (Kieron Hardy)
- changed: Scheme->Racket for generated code
- changed: output to frame instead of to console
- fix: tab-panel crash and removed need for single-panel
- added: add version to project file and check version on open
- changed: modify label to false-or-string for some GUI widgets
- changed: modify some number properties to false-or-number for some GUI widgets

Version 3.8
  Laurent Orseau, 2012-02-04
- added: can now take projects as command line arguments
  Ex: gracket main.ss my-project.med
- fixed: tab-panel child selection bug when empty child list

  Fixes by Kieron Hardy:
- fixed: tooltip.ss was not always removing tooltip on windows
- fixed: mreddesigner.bat : small DOS issues

Version 3.7
  Laurent Orseau, 2010-07-26
- changed: images (files) are *always* relative to project base directory,
  except if the project has never been saved.
- added: runtime-paths? property for projects: if checked, all files (like images) 
  in the generated code are defined as runtime-paths.
- added: images are loaded with 'unknown/mask for transparency on buttons and messages
- changed: ids are not provided by default, except for frames and dialogs

Version 3.6
  Laurent Orseau, 2010-07-21
- added: code-gen-class property: the class name can also be a keyword argument 
  of the init function in the generated code
- added: false-or-number. x, y, width, height can take either the value false
  or be a number, as they should.
- removed: moving the frame/dialog changes x and y, widht and height
  (was more annoying than anything).
- changed: load-preferences.ss -> .ssd to avoid planet inject warnings

Version 3.5
  Laurent Orseau, 2010-07-16
- fixed: moving carret in property text-fields
- fixed: bug of text-field-number (validation is now done on pressing update)

  Laurent Orseau, 2010-06-19
- added template: login/password dialog 
- added "show-at-init" option in frames and dialogs
- added post-code for plugins
- fixed: top level sub-windows are really destroyed
- fixed: windows are hidden until completely created
- MODIFIED: "generate file as..." menu item + "To <project-id>.ss" button
  instead of asking each time where to write

Version 3.2
  Laurent Orseau, 2010-04-06
- Fixed non-provided init function name

Version 3.1
  Laurent Orseau, 2010-03-23
- Font editor uses get-font-from user
- Fixed bugs in loading projects

Version 3.0
  Laurent Orseau, March 1st 2010
- Almost complete rewrite of the code
- Generic way to edit properties (even for styles and fonts)
- The mred-id% object represents the abstraction of one widget
- Generic way to add widgets, using a plugin system
  It is almost easy to create a new widget plugin.
- Added templates: a widget + children can be saved to a template and inserted
  anywhere else
  (copy/paste and projects files use templates)
  - Generic way to write the constructor code of an object
    (fields can be aselected, or default behavior overriden)
- Every property can be an option of the generated code
- Added widgets: menus, dialog, combo-field
- check-boxes and buttons can have images as label
- Fixed grow-spacer-box-panel
- The hierarchy frame now uses a hierarchy-list%
- Can edit several projects at the same time.
  (a project can even be loaded several times)
- Lost features: 
    - callback graph editor
    - class options in the generated code
    - move-one-up and down, but can use cut/paste
    - copy without children
    - generate only required code 
     (because widgets may have different default values than the MrEd ones)
    

Version 2.2
  Laurent Orseau, January 10th 2010
- code generation creates a module that can be required as an external module
- evaluating the generated module does not initialize the frames and does not show them;
  One must call something like (my-project-init), with the desired options
- callbacks and classes are options of the initialization method,
  so that the application is fully parameterizable, and the file itself
  does not (or less) need by-hand modifications. Suche things can be done in a separate file.
- the gui variables are `provide'd so that they can be used from the outside
- changed default option in code generation to "only required"
- toolbox-frame is now the parent frame of hierarchy-frame, property-frame, and callback-graph-frame,
  so that (on Vista at least) there is only one tab in the OS app bar, and all frames are 
  minimized and unminimized at once with the toolbox
- in default-values.ss:
    * changed all the "special classes" to use a mred-id%% mixin
    * changed module language to scheme
    * changed hash-tables to hashes
    * all default-preview and default-values are stored in an hash (toward a plugin architecture)


Version 2.1.3
- tooltips are added to main buttons
- fixed the no-border style for tab-panels

Version 2.1.2
- fixed a bug with widget cutting and pasting
- tab-panels are working properly

Version 2.1.1
- modified way how to react on the clicking in the preview window

Version 2.1
- new callback handling is added
- the id of a widget can be changed, except the root "project"
- Now it remembers whether a frame was closed down so it does not 
  pop-up when doing full preview
- in the graph editor window the list-box is resizable
- special callbacks are created for radio-box, check-box, choice and
  slider, so by clicking in the preview the selection will be reflected 
  in the property window


Version 2.0
- new hierarchy widget, like a new widget type with separate internal data
- simplified and reorganised code for hierarchy widget and preview
- new type of property widget, specially derived classes
- style properties are handled separately by pull-down widgets
- when generating Scheme code, it can write max or min code
- Copy, Cut and Paste is implemented
- by clicking on a widget in the preview, the properties window will show
  the properties of the clicked widget
- keyboard events are added to the hierarchy window,
  Del, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V, Shift+Up, Shift+Down


Version 1.1.1
- The position and size of the preview is also stored and restored
  17th April, 2006, Peter Ivanyi
- The GUI and functionality are separated for hierarchy
  17th April, 2006, Peter Ivanyi
